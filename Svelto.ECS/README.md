Svelto Entity Component System for Unity
=====================================

Real Entity-Component-System for c# and Unity (it can be adapted for other c# platforms too). Enables to write encapsulated, uncoupled, highly efficient, data oriented, cache friendly, multi-threaded, code without pain.

you can find working examples to learn how to use the framework here:

https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto-ECS-Example (unity)

https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example (.net core and standard)

I advise to clone the example repositories separately from the framework one, both under the same Unity project Assets folder.

Note: if you ever build something with Svelto.ECS that you can share with the community, please do and let me know. Other coders need more examples.
